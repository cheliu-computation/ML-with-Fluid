In this repository, I have applied EnKF on three numerical example:
1. Vonkamn Vortex, a two-dimensional incompressible viscous fluid with periodic motion state.
2. Water Collapse, a two-dimensional fluid example simulated as dam break.
3. Backward2d, https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov/backstep_val.html

In the water collapse and Backward2d folder, I have applied two different way to assimilated data with EnKF, assimilating the code with low-dimension and the raw data.
